# sharedWallet
In this project, I coded a shared wallet via Smart Contracts on Remix. There are two Smart Contracts that run the shared wallet logics. The first called "SharedWallet" is where the functions for receiving and withdrawing ether are written. Another called "Allowance" is where the functions of how the allowances are distributed for each shared wallet member are written. The "Ownable" Smart Contract from OpenZeppelin was also implemented, since it is an already audited Smart Contract for ownership management. The two Smart Contracts were separated in two files and, then, properly integrated.
